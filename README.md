# Miscrit Simulator Web App

This project is a web-based simulator built with React.js that allows users to simulate the stats and bonuses of a Miscrit character at level 35. It provides multiple customization options and helps users see how different bonuses and genetics affect the final stats.

## Features

### 1. Miscrit Simulation
- Simulate what your Miscrit might look like when it reaches **level 35**.
- Filter the list of Miscrits using the **filter menu**.

### 2. Options Menu
- Toggle **Platinum Training** and **Bonus Points** on or off.
- Use the **Rebonus** feature to randomize all active bonus or platinum points.

### 3. Stats Menu
- Hover over **icons** or **statistics** to view the applied bonuses.
- Click on any icon or statistic to change its genetic to **white**, **green**, or **red** to see how different genetics impact the stats.
- By default, bonus points for level 35 Miscrits are disabled. In the game, a level 35 Miscrit receives **102 bonus points**, which are automatically and randomly assigned.
- Edit the bonus point distribution by clicking the **"Edit Bonus"** button.

## How to Use
1. **Simulate Miscrit Stats**: Select a Miscrit and adjust its stats to see what it might look like at level 35.
2. **Customize Genetics and Bonuses**: Use the options and stats menus to tweak genetics and bonus points to your preference.
3. **View Changes**: Hover over stats to get a detailed view of applied bonuses.
4. **Set or Randomize**: Manually adjust your Miscrit's bonus stats or randomize them using the Rebonus feature.
